event-espresso-core
===================

This is the Core for Event Espresso 4.0+

### Current Active Branch: *development*

Please note that we are not going to be releasing the code that is found in "master" or the "4.0-BETA" branch.  There are significant db changes between what's in *master* and what's in *development* due to the implementation of custom post types for events, venues, and attendees.  An accurate representation of what is eventually going to be released is in development.

Note also, this is a private repo, and it will remain private even if you choose to fork it.  We will look at any pull requests but keep in mind that EE4+ is still in very active development and its likely that any pull requests related to bugs are issues we are already aware of and working on.
