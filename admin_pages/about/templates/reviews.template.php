							<p>I’ve been using Event Espresso for over 2 years for multiple websites which host a variety of events, classes, and conferences.  The software has been versatile, easy to use/customize to meet our needs, WordPress themes, and organization.</p>
							<p>The customer service is hands down the best customer service I’ve interacted with in years.  On several occasions their customer service and support have assisted with their product, guidance, and helping to integrate their product with other software.</p>
							<p>Recently after a billing kerfuffle, the Event Espresso customer service came to the rescue and kept my services from lapsing.  It’s service like this that will keep my organization coming back for years to come.</p>
							<p>Thanks for the great speedy service!!</p>

							<p>Event Espresso was easy to setup and is easy to use. It’s also easy to style for individual websites. It has some really great features – events are simple to setup, events table(s) and calendar which can show colour coded events and simple payment integration. When we started, the plugin was in version 3 (EE3) and we’ve stuck with that however the latest version 4 (EE4) has been completely revamped and comes with added functionality.</p>
							<p>The support staff have always been very helpful and will work with you when there are issues (even to the point of logging into the back-end of a site) to try to resolve any problems.</p>
							<p>We look forward to continuing to work with Event Espresso.</p>

							<p>Event Espresso 4 (paid) is feature-packed and really simple to use. The base program provides everything we need (though we did purchase a payment gateway) including multiple ticketing levels and the ability to collect highly detailed customer info through forms. I was impressed at how much can be done with just EE4 Premium in comparison to other programs. Would love to see more purchasable themes and add-ons for the event list pages, but the plugin itself is fantastic. Couldn’t recommend it more! </p>

							<p>Great product for managing our educational course offerings. We manage students, collect fees, create complex student information forms to collect data. Event Espresso provides maximum versatility for configuring each event uniquely. It lets us assign different managers to different courses, we manage by department… Garth and his team have added many features that we asked for over the years. [link removed] has been registering students for our courses since the beginning of Event Espresso, in 2008. Great product, keep up the good work!</p>

							<p>We use Event Espresso with another plugin for our annual science meeting. We needed information regarding how to use registration information from EE to connect members account information to an abstract submission plugin. Each request for information was answered rapidly – the fastest response I have ever received from a plugin developer! Thanks!</p>
