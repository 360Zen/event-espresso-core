<h4>Before Contacting Support</h4>
<p>Please understand that our primary goal is to offer Event Espresso as a very low cost solution compared to building your own system or using a 3rd party service to handle your registrations.</p><p> As with most open source programs (and closed licensed programs), chances are you will find the occasional bug, glitch, white screen of death, and/or general failure. Please don't panic!</p>
<p>If your problems are not urgent, please post in our <a href="http://eventespresso.com/forums/" target="_blank">support forums</a>. If you need immediate help. Please purchase a support token below, at which time you can schedule time with a dedicated support tech or core developer.</p>
