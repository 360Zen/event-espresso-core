# Getting started with the EE Developer Docs

In this docs folder is all the developer documentation specific to EE core.  Located in the various folders are the documentation regarding the various systems in EE.

> We generally add new documentation, or edit existing documentation specific to the code in the branch this folder lives.  So depending on the branch you are viewing this in, the documentation could be different than other branches.

## Where do I leave comments/questions?

If you have any questions  regarding any of the documentation, we invite you to open up issues in our [github repo](https://github.com/eventespresso/event-espresso-core/issues).  If you have suggestions for edits to the documentation, please submit a pull request with
your suggestions.
